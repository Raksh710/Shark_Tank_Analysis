# Shark_Tank_Analysis
Predicting whether a company on ABC's popular program "Shark Tank" accepted an offer is our goal. Entrepreneurs present their ideas to a panel of investors on the show Shark Tank, which debuted in 2009. In exchange for stock, the entrepreneur requests that the investors invest money. Investors have two options: they either decide not to invest or make an offer (usually with less enticing terms than those put forth by the entrepreneur).  This dataset contains the information of all episodes from Season 1 to Season 9. The target column is 'Deal_Yes'.
